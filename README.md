# graphics-engine
Graphics Engine built in High School for my Graphics class

## How To Run
Run ```make test``` or ```make test2``` to show a predefined image, otherwise use ```python3 main.py <ENTER NAME OF MDL FILE>``` The rules for how to create an MDL file are in MDL.spec.

WARNING: Many of the commands in MDL.spec are either not implemented, or do not have their full functionality, so be careful of those.


## Why Did I Make This?
This was made for my Graphics class in High School. It uses a skeleton, but I personally implemented straight lines, curves, transformations, polygons, 3d shapes, scan line conversion to fill in these shapes, lighting, and mdl to make it easier to read.
